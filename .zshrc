# --- ssh-agent: one persistent agent reachable from every shell ----------
# macOS only hands its launchd ssh-agent to GUI apps, so inbound SSH sessions
# (and some terminals) start with SSH_AUTH_SOCK unset and `ssh-add` dies with
# "Could not open a connection to your authentication agent". Pin the socket to
# a stable path and start one agent only if none is reachable; every shell then
# reuses it, so a key added once stays loaded until reboot. Passphrase + key
# loading are handled lazily by ~/.ssh/config (AddKeysToAgent + UseKeychain).
